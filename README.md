# FordGoBike Sharing System Analysis
## by Umar Muhammed Abubakar


## Dataset

>Like other bike share services, Ford GoBike uses a fleet of sturdy, durable bikes that are locked into a system of docking stations spread across the city of San francisco. The bikes are perfect for one-way travels because they may be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the network. The bike share program is used by people for a variety of purposes, including getting to and from work, school, and doing errands. It is a fun, efficient, and inexpensive mode of transportation.
This dataset has 183,412 observations across 16 variables, including ride duration (Secs), start and end times, start and end station longitudes and latitudes, bike ids, user types, member birth year, member genders, start and end station names, and bike share for all trips
